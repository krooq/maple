## What is Maple?

Maple as a project aims to achieve 3 primary goals:
1. Provide simple "cross platform" *rendering* capabilites
2. Provide a simple *UI toolkit* for trivial UI use cases
3. Provide a simple *UI design app* for trivial UI use cases

## What Maple is **not**?

The following are **not** in the scope of Maple:
- Complex UI widgets
- Text shaping i.e. left to right, one-to-one, monospaced fonts only
- Complex layouting, simple grid layouts only

## Roadmap
- Renderer
- Basic UI toolkit
- UI design app

## Principles
The design of Maple is driven by high level principles rather than rules or conventions.

These principles are:
1. Simplicity
2. Practicality
3. Empowerment

From the above principles Maple derives the following ethos:
- Easy to learn
- Easy to use
- Runs as fast as possible
- Doesn't get in your way
- Interoperable
- Extensible
